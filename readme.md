# **Currency Converter Chrome Extension**
The Currency Converter Chrome Extension is a tool designed for easy conversion of any amount to any known National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) currency on any webpage. It automatically converts selected text on the current browser tab page to Ukrainian hryvnia if, of course, the selected text contains a sum and the code of any currency listed in the NBU's JSON object (https://bank.gov.ua/NBUStatService/v1/statdirectory/exchange?json).

This extension is available on a completely free basis. When the extension is installed, the JSON object obtained from the above website is added to the local storage object along with the refresh period, which is set to 8 hours. The extension also comes with its own interface, where users can enter any amount, select the desired currency, and get the converted result in hryvnia.
